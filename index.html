                        <strong>1. Inception (1991-1992)</strong><br> The story of Java starts at Sun Microsystems in 1991 when a team of engineers, 
                        including James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, began working on a project called the "Green Project." The aim was to create a programming language for consumer electronics. <br>
                        The project initially produced a language called "Oak," designed for embedded systems and handheld devices. Oak was named after an oak tree outside James Gosling's office.
                    </li>
                    <li class="li-class">
                        <strong>2. Renaming to Java (1994)</strong><br> In 1994, the team realized that "Oak" was not a unique name and was already trademarked by other companies, leading to a renaming challenge. <br>
                        The name "Java" was chosen as the new moniker. It was inspired by the coffee culture at Sun Microsystems, with "Java" referring to the coffee from Indonesia, where one of the team members had visited.
                    </li>
                    <li class="li-class">
                        <strong>3. Introduction to the Public (1995)</strong><br> On May 23, 1995, Sun Microsystems officially introduced Java to the public with the release of Java 1.0. This marked the beginning of Java's journey as a widely adopted programming language.
                    </li>
                    <li class="li-class">
                        <strong>4. Java Applets and Web Revolution (Mid-1990s)</strong><br> Java quickly gained attention due to its ability to run "applets" in web browsers. These applets brought interactivity and dynamic content to the early web, sparking the "applet revolution."<br>
                        Java's platform independence and "write once, run anywhere" capability made it a popular choice for web development.
                    </li>
                    <li class="li-class">
                        <strong>5. Java 2 and Enterprise Java (Late 1990s)</strong><br> Java 2 (J2SE) was introduced in December 1998, bringing significant improvements and the Swing GUI toolkit. <br>
                        Java's versatility led to its adoption in enterprise software development. The Enterprise Edition (Java EE) was introduced to address the needs of large-scale applications.
                    </li>
                    <li class="li-class">
                        <strong>6. Legal Battles (Late 1990s to Early 2000s)</strong><br>Sun Microsystems engaged in legal disputes with Microsoft over Microsoft's use of Java in its products. These legal battles had a significant impact on Java's development and distribution.
                    </li>
                    <li class="li-class">
                        <strong>7. Open Sourcing (2006)</strong><br> In November 2006, Sun Microsystems released the source code of the Java platform under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This open-source version of Java was known as OpenJDK (Java Development Kit).
                    </li>
                    <li class="li-class">
                        <strong>8. Continued Evolution (2000s to Present)</strong><br> Java continued to evolve with regular releases, introducing new features and APIs. Notable versions include Java 5 (introducing generics), Java 8 (with lambdas and the Stream API), and Java 11 (a long-term support release). <br>
                        Java also played a pivotal role in the development of Android, powering a large portion of the world's mobile devices.

                    <li class="li-class">
                        <strong>9. Oracle's Acquisition of Java (2010)</strong><br> In 2010, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems, becoming the steward of Java. This acquisition raised questions about the future of Java's development and licensing.
                    </li>
                    <li class="li-class">
                        <strong>10. Ongoing Development and Community Involvement</strong> Java's development has continued with an active community and regular updates. <br>
                        Projects like Project Valhalla (value types) and Project Loom (simplified concurrency) aim to enhance Java's capabilities and performance.
                    </li>
                    <li class="li-class">
                        <strong>11. Java Today</strong><br>Java remains a fundamental language in software development, with widespread use in web applications, mobile app development (Android), big data processing, cloud computing, and more.
